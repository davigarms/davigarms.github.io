                                Since I was a kid I have a passion for build things, like Lego and all kinds of toys with blocks, screws and electric motors. And back in the 80s, having an early contact with technology on old computers like Apple-II and MSX, I had the opportunity to play old games and much more, like editing a community newspaper with my friends and acessing teletext interfaces. My dad, observing my interest, soon introduced me to Basic, and it was love at first sight.     
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Later on, when we chat on mIRC and ICQ, Altavista was the most popular search site and Hotmail didn't even belong to Microsoft, I learned HTML and designed my first sites even before I graduated in Design. And finally, as a Digital Designer, soon I discovered Flash, which led me to learn ActionScript 3, a structured OOP language based on EcmaScript that opened the door to what was come next.

                                Now, with all my interests and experience in different areas, I feel that I can contribute a lot with my vision and skills focusing on my passion to collaborate where technology and people meet.

                                I have a lot of experience working with Javascript, including the use of npm, Gulp, CSS pre-processors like SASS, and template engines like Handlebars and Pug. I also have some experience with PHP and MySQL databases.

                                Although my great interest in technology, I decided on Graphic Design graduation. In that time, it was unclear the difference between UX or Visual Design roles, and designers were generally people with great graphic skills, which wasn't my case. Even so, feeling that Design had different dimensions, and with a creative side to explore, I shot for the stars. A great choice, leading me to discover a broad range of disciplines essential for a design role, including digital ones. And then I became a Digital Designer, allowing me to fulfil my tech interests with a sensibility to understand complex scenarios and look closely at people and their relationship with technology.

                                Most recently, I also had a chance to act as a Product Owner, which allowed me to better understand the business perspective and the challenges to conciliate desirability, feasibility and viability dimensions, to achieve great and meaningful products that make a difference for people.
