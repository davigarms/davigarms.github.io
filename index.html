                            <p>
                                Since I was a child, I have a passion for build things, like Lego and all kinds of toys with blocks, screws and electric motors. And back in the 80s, having an early contact with technology on computers such as Apple-II and MSX, I had the opportunity not only to play games but to discover an entirely new world. I was able to edit a community newspaper in graphic apps with my friends, access a Videotext service, learning Basic programming from my dad and much more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Later on, in the 90s, when we still used to chat on mIRC and ICQ, Altavista was the most popular search site, and Hotmail didn't even belong to Microsoft, I learned HTML and designed my first sites. But although my great interest in the technology area, I decided on Graphic Design graduation. In that time, it was unclear the difference between UX, UI or Visual Design roles, and designers were generally people with incredible graphic skills, which wasn't my case. However, feeling that Design had different dimensions and a creative side to explore, I shot for the stars and Design.
                            
                            </p>
                            <p>    
                                As a Digital Designer, I was able to fulfil my technical interests and look closely at people and their relationship with technology. And I also discovered Flash, which led me to learn ActionScript 3, an Object-oriented programming language based on EcmaScript, looking like a mix of Java and Javascript with stunning graphics. But that was a long time ago.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                With the end of Flash, I learned Javascript and modern HTML, and have worked in complex development environments since then, including the use of Npm, Gulp, CSS pre-processors like SASS, and template engines like Handlebars and Pug. I also have some experience with PHP and MySQL databases.

                                Having a Design background, I always start looking from the user perspective, concerned with UX questions, which is crucial for product success. And recently, I have been working as a Product Manager, being closer to the business.  I learned a lot about the challenge of integrating desirability, feasibility and viability, prioritising what is most important and keep testing and improving to achieve significant products.

                                Now, relocated from Brazil at the end of 2019, bringing my experience in different areas, I am keen on collaborating with my vision and skills, focusing on my passion for developing and bring things to life.
