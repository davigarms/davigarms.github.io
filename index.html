                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Since I was a child, I have a passion for build things, always playing with Lego and all kinds of toys with blocks, screws and electric motors. And back in the 80s, having early contact with technology on computers such as Apple-II and MSX, I discovered an entirely new world. I could play electronic games, edit a community newspaper in graphic apps with my friends, access Videotext services, learn Basic programming and much more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Later on, through the 90s, when we still used to chat on mIRC and ICQ, Altavista used to be the most popular search engine available, and Netscape ruled the World Wide Web, I learned HTML and designed my first websites. And awakened to the internet, I decided on Graphic Design graduation. Designers were generally people with incredible drawing skills, which wasn't my case. However, feeling that Design had different dimensions to explore, I shot for the stars and made my choice.
                            </p>
                            <p>    
                                By becoming a Digital Designer, I was able to fulfil my technical interests and look closely at people and their relationship with technology. Flash was in the spotlight, which led me to learn ActionScript, an Object-oriented programming language based on EcmaScript, looking like a mix of Java and Javascript with stunning graphics. But that was a long time ago.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                With the end of Flash, I learned Javascript and modern HTML, working in complex development environments since then, using Npm, Gulp, CSS pre-processors like SASS, and template engines like Handlebars and Pug. And I also have some experience with PHP and MySQL databases.

                            <p>
                                Having a multidisciplinary knowledge and leadership profile, I was invited to a Project Manager position and taken up the challenge. It was a turning point in my career, where I learned a lot about the business. To move from Waterfall to Agile was the next step, and I found a lot about integrating desirability, feasibility and viability, to prioritise what is most valuable and continuously improve to achieve significant products.

                                Now, relocated from Brazil at the end of 2019, bringing my experience in different areas, I am keen on collaborating with my vision and skills, focusing on my passion for developing and bring things to life.
