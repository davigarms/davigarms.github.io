                            <p>
                                Since I was a kid, I have a passion for build things, including Lego and all kinds of toys with blocks, screws and electric motors. And back in the 80s, having an early contact with technology on old computers such as Apple-II and MSX, I had the opportunity to play old games and much more, like editing a community newspaper with my friends and accessing Videotext. My dad, observing my interest, soon introduced me to Basic, and it was love at first sight.   
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                
                                Later on, when we used to chat on mIRC and ICQ, Altavista was the most popular search site, and Hotmail didn't even belong to Microsoft, I learned HTML and designed my first sites. But although my great interest in the technology area, I decided on Graphic Design graduation. In that time, it was unclear the difference between UX, UI or Visual Design roles, and designers were generally people with incredible graphic skills, which wasn't my case. Even so, feeling that Design had different dimensions to discover, and with a creative side to explore, I shot for the stars and for Design.
                            </p>
                            <p>    
                                As a Digital Designer, I was able to fulfil my technical interests and look closely at people and their relationship with technology. And I also discovered Flash, which led me to learn ActionScript 3, an Object-oriented programming language based on EcmaScript, looking like a mix of Java and Javascript with stunning graphics. But that was a long time ago.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                With the end of Flash, I learned modern HTML and Javascript, including complex development environments using Npm, Gulp, CSS pre-processors like SASS, and template engines like Handlebars and Pug. I also have some experience with PHP and MySQL databases.

                                Having a Design background, I always start looking from the user perspective, concerned with user experience questions, which is crucial for product success. And recently, I have been working as a Product Owner, being closer to the business vision.  I learned a lot about the challenge of integrating desirability, feasibility and viability, prioritising what is most important and keep testing and improving to achieve significant products.
